# DocumentosOficiais
Simple crud project to store data to help me keep track of different types of oficial documents I work with at city council. The graphical interface is in Portuguese. 
The program saves date, number, subject, origin and destination of the documents as well as searches documents by any of these criteria. 
The graphical interface has to be improved.
There's a problem with the date picker that I used a temporary quick fix to work around but needs further investigation.
